            <p>My name is Ian Isern, an aspiring Front-End Developer currently living in Florida. I've been learning to code in my free time 
                with the help of Codecademy's web development course. As of May 14th, 2024, I've become certified in Front-End Development. </p>
                <br />
            <p>I'm an avid Tabletop Roleplaying Game Enjoyer and my favorites include Pathfinder and LANCER. I love music and I have also been 
                learning to play the bass guitar on the side. My favorite bands include King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, black midi, and Casiopea.
                When I'm not doing either of these you can find me putting together model kits known as "gunpla". They are mecha model kits based 
                around the popular anime series "Mobile Suit Gundam".</p>
                <br />
            <p>While I still have much to learn, I'm eager to tackle any challenge that comes my way. I've spent most of my life trying to acquire 
                new skills, teaching myself on a plethora of topics that interest me personally as I feel that there is always something new to learn 
                from. I am always striving to be a better person through the challenge of learning.</p>
